	"master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, " +
	"who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, " +
	"buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, " +
	"the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, " +
	"deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of " +
	"observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless " +
	"by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa " +
	"in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at " +
	"Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the " +
	"reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the " +
	"readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.";
